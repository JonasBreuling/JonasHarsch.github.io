I passed the admission to the top degree program **[simulation technology](http://www.studium-simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/)**. My key courses are 

- *nonlinear continuum mechanics*
- *computational mechanics*
- *parallel numerics*
- *advanced C++*

Currently I'm doing my master thesis at the [institute for nonlinear mechanics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html) with the topic *"Spagetthi and Inverse Spagetthi Problem Revisited"*. In summer 2018 I will finish my master degree.
