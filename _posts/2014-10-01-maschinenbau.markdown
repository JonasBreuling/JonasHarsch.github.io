Started to study **[mechanical engineering](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/mabau/)** in the third semester. I spezialized myself in *computational fluid dynamics* and *nonlinear mechanics*. With the bachelor thesis *"Finite element formulation for planar nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam with B-Spline shape functions"* at the [institute for nonlinear mechanics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html) I finished my bachelor degree.
