I passed the admission to the top degree program [simulation technology](http://www.studium-simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/). My key courses are 

- nonlinear continuum mechanics
- computational mechanics
- parallel numerics
- advanced C++

I successfully completed my Master's Degree with a thesis at the [institute for nonlinear mechanics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/index.html) with the topic *"Dynamic Modeling of Beams with Non-Material Boundary Conditions"*.
