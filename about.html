Iâ€™m a research and teaching assistant at the [institute for nonlinear mechanics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/index.html) at university of Stuttgart. My key interests are 

- **Nonlinear continuum mechanis** (nonlinear beam theories, second gradient materials, pantographic structures)
- **Isogeometric analysis**
- **Numerical analysis**
- **Programming** (*python*, *C++*, *fortran*, *cmake*)
- **Parallel computing**

Current projects can be found on my [research hompage](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institut/employees/Harsch-00003/).
